This is a HackGT X (hackthon) project where we worked on creating a crowd sourcing personal teaching platform.
[Link to devpost](https://devpost.com/software/pinnacle-ai).

Its features are - 
- Ability to take in any pdf content and provide it to all users.
- Train a contextual LLM model of the content.
- Provide a short summary and downloadable pdf notes.
- Quiz the user on practically infinite numbers of questions based on the context.
- Chatbot to clearify questions on the content.
- Embed any youtbe/ twitch/ discord video to the application.
- Create a chatbot with a contextual understanding of a recorded or live video.

To replicate the results, you need to use an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MONGOBD_CONNECTION`.
