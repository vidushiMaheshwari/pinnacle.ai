map are searching, inserting, and deleting items. • Maps can be implemented using lists, arrays, or linked lists. • Implementations using either arrays or linked list are easy, and both result in O(n) search performance. • Depending on the key, performance can be reduced to O(logn)). 3 Maps Maps • The main operations of a map are searching, inserting, and deleting items. • Maps can be implemented using lists, arrays, or linked lists. • Implementations using either arrays or linked list are easy, and both result in O(n) search performance. • Depending on the key, performance can be reduced to O(logn)). • (If keys were like an index in an array, then access can be achieved in O(1).) 3 Maps Map ADT • The Map Interface enforces the generic type <K,V>. • The Map ADT has the following methods: • get(k): map M has an entry with key k, return its associated value; else, return null • put(k, v): insertentry(k, v)intomapM;ifkeykisnotalready in M, then return null; else, return old value associated with k • remove(k): map M has an entry with key k, remove it from M and return its associated value; else, return null • size(), isEmpty() • entrySet(): return an iterable collection of the entries in M • keySet(): return an iterable collection of the keys in M • values(): return an iterator of the values in M 4 • A hash map is similar to a map, but it uses a hash function of the key to compute the index for storing the pair <K, V> in an array. • In order to use the hash code, keys must be converted to integers, if not already integers. • If the integer keys are not in the given range (0 to N −1), then a HASH function is used to map the keys to corresponding indices in a table. • Hash maps are generally implemented using an array (so that you have O(1) access to any index). Maps Hash Maps • Maps support the abstraction of using integer keys as indices. The capacity of the map is N, and indices range 0 to N −1. 5 • In order to use the hash code, keys must be converted to integers, if not already integers. • If the integer keys are not in the given range (0 to N −1), then a HASH function is used to map the keys to corresponding indices in a table. • Hash maps are generally implemented using an array (so that you have O(1) access to any index).
